<h2>WHY GMAING ?</h2>
    <p2> so you might ask me why gaming is my hobby, well 
        since this pandamic begined i was unable to get out of my house and wander around.
        so i was looking an option to kill my time and the top results was gaming, this desicion also 
        gave me an advantage and that was to play with my friends online also i could creat my gaming rig and overclock it to push it's limts.
        
        Well since this hobby killed my bordem but latter on the game statrs to get old and not fun 
        so i did spend some money on buying games from the microsoft store and spent some money on my gaming rig tom upgrade it. 
        
        so yea this is the reason.

        <h1> Elon Musk</h1>
            <p id="elonpara">lon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is an internet entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the founder, CEO and chief engineer of SpaceX; early stage investor,[note 1] CEO, and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. A centibillionaire, Musk is one of the richest people in the world.

Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada aged 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received bachelors' degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999</p>
